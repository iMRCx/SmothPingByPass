# SmothPingByPass
A mod focused on reducing autocrystal and surround latency for servers like 2b2t.org and 2b2tpvp.net
(Mod Currently in development)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically The Mod works with the help of Haste API. This platform is designed to reduce ping with competitive games.
The Mod will work as a bridge between the haste servers and the autocrystal and surround modules
The mod will only work to reduce auto crystal and surround latency. In order not to saturate Haste's broadband
Also the mod configuration will be optimized for 2b2tpvp.net and 2b2t.org. When the first version of the mod is released, the community will be able to adapt the code and optimize the mod for other minecraft servers.
